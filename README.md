# Lijie & Kyle - Map App

### The map app should be tested on an iPhone instead of simulator
#### Note: It works on the simulator, but the user location of simulator is in California, and simulator is really slow

### Each annotation pin on the map represents a parking lot with data
#### Note: the title is the number of available spaces, and the subtitle which is shown when clicked, is the name of the parking lot

##3 Data of parking lots refresh every 20 second
#### Note: If set to smaller time interval it may cause GeoCoder error

### While navigating, route refresh whenever new user location data is available
#### Note: You may see route blinking
#### The app has been tested outside to ensure navigation works (driving only)
